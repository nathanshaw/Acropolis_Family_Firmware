/* 
// version 0.1.1 made the woodpecker functionality a part of the playback_engine, and is stable for that build


// version 0.4.5 integrated the weathermanager into the v3 Speculator code (minus the proper shutdown procedures due
   to hardware limitations), fixed issue with the LuxManager not actually forcing lux readings 
   when it needs to. Now the lux manager and the weather manager should both be operating as expected
// version 0.4.4 fixed some issues with the Speculator v3 implementation of the firmware, the user controls were 
   expanded and fixed up a big, fixed a major issue with getting the VEML6030 sensors to work in the same way
   as the VEML7700 sensors (the lux readings were off and some issues were present with the library)
  
// version 0.4.3 added the luxmanager calibrate function back into the code, it is the firmware used for a pop-up installation in late september

// version 0.4.1 is attempting to add the lux manager back into the mix, the crashing issue is fixed, but the brightness
   scaler functionality is broken
// version 0.4.0 fixed the vast majority of the bugs associated with v 0.3.1, there is still an issue with the lux manager,
   but this version is stable
// version 0.3.1 moved many of the classes into the Arduino general libray, for some reason the restart issue is back
   and there are problems with printing, this is not a real working version, just an inbetween
// version 0.3.0 has lots of changes under the hood concerning how the classees are treated. For the v3 units the temp
   and humidity sensor and the WeatherManager was addded. There is a huge problem with the program having a memory leak
   somewhere, I really neeed to find that beforee v 1.0 can be launched
// version 0.2.7-8 xxxx
   updated some code that used long if/else statements to usee switch/case statements instead. Applied the 
   loacal brightness scalers to all values. Bunch of other minor things to get ready for the next field expedition.
   v8 added hue stuff
// version 0.2.6 removed many global variables which were not being used, moved most global variables to the 
   start of Mode.h and removed a good amount of clutter from the program. This included removing the extra Neopixel manager, 
   and support for "stereo" visual feedback. An option to change the Lux Managers feedback was added so the Lux Manager can
   either update the brightness scaler or the Min/Max brightness for linked NeoPixel Managers.Fixed a bug in the
   smooth HSB where they were all smoothedd against brightness. Change thee code to only use one feature collector
   Updated the way that brightness_max works, now it looks at the brightness of all the LEDs together (so a max 
   value now is 765. Changed way that brightness scaler min and max is sent to the lux manager. v0.2.6 was pushed on 
   August 1st 2020
  
// version 0.2.5 added functionality for the thirdd jumper on v2.1. It now determines the amout of smoothing
   for the HSB values. it also reintegrated LBS into the pitch mode. Made it so you could overide the boot delay.
   Also fixed a bug with the center out feedback setting on the Moth v3. Lastly, HSB smoothing now
   applies to all values not just brightness. pushed v on 07/28/2020

// version 0.2.4 is an expansion of 0.2.3 and further improved the debug printing abilities of the
   progam as a whole. Fixed bug with the lux manager not polling correctly. Updated on 07/27/2020

// version 0.2.3 was created on 07/10/20 in reaction to thee field expedition, added threshold control 
   for the click thresholds using the 4th pot, switched around some of the user controls, a splt was made in
   thee functionality of the pins for v3.0 (removing the brightness scaler), the user brightness_scaler was fixed for
   pitch mode, control for the brightness threshold was added for the fourth pot, references to 'click'
   have been replaced with 'onset' which more accurately represents the functions abilities, improved the debug printing,

// version 0.2.2 was created on 07/07/20 and integrated the pitch and cicada modes for a field expedition

// version 0.2.1 was creaeted on 29.06.20 and got a working version of the code working for PCB v2.1 in Cicada Mode as well as
   improving the frame rate from 8 to 29, and adding support for PCB v3 in Cicada mode (minus the onset)

// version 0.2.0 was created on 07/05/20 as the first attempt to get everything workin on PCB v3

// version 0.1.0 was created on 25.02.20 to address issues with the ground enclosure not being as responsive
   as well as the autobrightness calibration routine being very visible and disruptive when resetting

// version 0.1.0 was created on 24.02.20 as it served as the first viable working song implementation

// version 0.0.5 was created on 20.02.20 in the field at Kiatoke Cicada Grove as a first reaction to 
   how version 0.0.4 was performing, the changes included higher starting gains, a brighter flash,
   and the addition of a flag to differentiate between adding the flash brightness of just displaying
   the brightness
